# ECE 398 Vertically Integrated Projects Git Workshop

This repository is meant to be a template for training students
on Git version control. This "repository" is located on [GitHub](https://github.com)
where you can "clone" it to your local machine, make changes, then "push" them to
your own "fork". 

## Workshop Topics

- What is Git
- How Git works (very briefly)
- Cloning this repository
- Making Changes
- Forking
- Pushing

## Intended Change

While you can do whatever you would like with this repository, the recommended
change is to edit the `main.py` file to greet you instead of world. Simply
replace "world" with your name (you can find further instructions in the
`main.py` file.)

## Special Files

The file you're reading right now is actually stored in the repository as
`README.md`. This is a special file that GitHub will display when you
navigate to the project's page. This allows you to better document/introduce
the code you store here.

## Command-line vs GUI Client

Git is fundamentally a command-line program: it is intended to be ran using
your system's terminal emulator. However, there are many a Git client to
make Git far friendlier to a beginner. 

[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) is by far the easiest
to use (but also lacking the most features). 

[VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview) has become
very capable in terms of it's built-in Git and GitHub interactions.

[GitExtensions](https://gitextensions.github.io/) Is a very good one as well,
much more feature-complete but a little more confusing.

[Fork](https://git-fork.com/) isn't free, but great for every-day use.

[GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) Is beautiful, but requires you
to purchase a subscription for certain (sometimes necessary) features.

## Resources

If you would like to learn more about Git or GitHub, I would recommend
playing with it and experimenting. You can [install Git](https://git-scm.com/install/)
and make a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account then create your own repo!
